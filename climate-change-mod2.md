# Climate change in the geological past
# Module 2: Pre-quaternary climate change

Earth system is in a perennial non-equilibrium state.

## Stratigraphy

Rocks are the archive of Earth's past history, and therefore climate.

Stratigraphic records may contain gaps (hiatuses).

## Tectonic time-scale climate change

Climate forcing:

1. Tectonic processes --> impact on oceanic currents
2. Earth's orbit changes
3. Strength of Sun changes --> increases over time (so far)

## Carbon cycle

### Exogenic

Surface or near-surface processes.

Near steady-state equilibrium.

Carbon reservoirs, their sizes and rates of exchange:

1. **Vegetation**: 610 Gt, full exchange in few years (2:1 sink:source to atmosphere and only source to soils)
2. **Atmosphere**: 600 Gt, full exchange in few years (1:1 sink:source to ocean top layers, mostly sink to soils) 
3. **Soils**: 1560 G, full exchange in few years (small source to ocean top layers)
4. **Ocean top (mixed) layers**: 1000 Gt, full exchange in few years
5. **Deep ocean**: 38 kGt, full exchange with top layers in some centuries, partly isolated by the thermocline (1:1 sink:source to top layers, small source to rocks)
6. **Rocks**: 66 MGt, full exchange in 100 ka or Ma (small source to atmosphere)

99% of Earth's available carbon is stored in rocks.

### Endogenic

Earth's interior (mantle and below) processes. We don't really know how much carbon is stored in the mantle.

Drive out of equilibrium the endogenic steady-state periods:

1. Greenhouse
2. Icehouse

Sources to exogenic:

1. **Volcanoes** and **hot springs** --> without their contribution all the $CO_{2}$ would be removed in just 4 ka
2. **Metamorphism** --> **decarbonation**

Sinks from exogenic:

1. **Weathering**

## Biosphere and climate

### Photosynthesis

Oceanic **photic** zone: 100 m.

Bioprocesses sequester $CO_{2}$ and other nutrients into ocean deeper layers. Nutrients are upwelled and $CO_{2}$ is accumulated in sediments.
