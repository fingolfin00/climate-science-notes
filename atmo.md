## Thermodynamics

Study of **equilibrium states** of a **system** undergoing **energy transformation** (mechanical work $\Leftrightarrow$ heat).

### Definitions

Thermodynamics basic concepts applied to the atmosphere.

1. **System**: a parcel of air
    1. **Open** system: can exchange matter and energy $\Rightarrow$ complex treatment
    2. **Closed** system: can exchange only energy, not matter. Approximation is OK for:
        1. Large systems
        2. Part of a larger homogeneous system
    3. **Isolated** system: no exchange
2. **State** of a system: for a homogeneous fluid is fully determined by the **equation of state**, i.e. the functional relation between:
    1. Pressure $p$
    2. Volume $V$ (geometry, shape is not relevant (?))
    3. Temperature $T$
    4. Concentrations of mixture components
3. Extensive and intensive quantities/variables:
    1. **Extensive**: depending on mass, e.g.: volume, work, entropy
    2. **Intensive**: independent on mass, e.g.: temperature, pressure, density, specific work and heat
4. **Equilibrium state**: does not change if external conditions do not change too. With respect to small variations applied to it, it can be:
    1. **Stable**: staying in equilibrium
    2. **Unstable**: exiting equilibrium
    3. **Metastable**: staying in equilibrium for small changes of certain variables but exiting it for small changes of other variables
5. **Trasformation**: takes a system from an initial to a final state and is represented by a curve plotted in a state variable graph. Can be:
    1. **(Ir)Reversible**: (not) made of infinitesimal deviations from the initial and final equilibrium states
    2. **Cyclic**: goes back to the initial state (can be reversible or irreversible)
    3. **Isotherm** (constant $T$), **isochoric** (constant $V$) or **isobaric** (constant $p$)
    4. **Adiabatic**: the system does not exchange heat with the environment during the transformation (cannot be isothermal)
6. Energy
    1. Total energy of point-like particles: $E = K + P$
        1. **Kinetic energy** $K$: **internal** kinetic energy (sum of kinetic energies of all particles about the center of gravity) + kinetic energy of center of gravity
        2. **Potential energy** $P$: **internal** potential energy (due to interaction of particles) + external forces potential energy
    2. **Internal energy** $U$: sum of interal potential and kinetic energy
        1. **Conservative system**: $\frac{dU}{dt} = 0$

### Humidity

#### Dew and frost points

Consider an air parcel in contact with a surface of pure liquid water at a certain temperature $T$ at constant pressure. In order to reach a saturation ($w = w_s$)the air parcel must be cooled up to the **dew point** temperature $T_d$. The dew point depression is $T - T_d$.

Simarly consider an air parcel in contact with a surface of pure ice. The **frost point** temperature is such that the air parcel reaches saturation with ice ($w = w_f$).

#### Wet-bulb temperature

The temperature of an air parcel that is cooled by evaporation (water continuously provided) at constant pressure until it reaches saturation.
